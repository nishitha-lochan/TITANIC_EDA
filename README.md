# Titanic EDA Project

This project explores the famous Titanic dataset using Python libraries like **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers such as:
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Sex**: Gender
- **Age**: Age in years
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Embarked**: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
- **Survived**: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Steps Performed
1. Data cleaning (handling missing values, correcting data types)
2. Feature engineering (creating new columns like `FamilySize`, `IsAlone`)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with **Seaborn** & **Matplotlib**
4. Visualizations of survival by age, sex, class, and more

## Tools Used
- Python üêç
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
- Women had a higher survival rate compared to men.
- First-class passengers had better chances of survival.
- Passengers traveling alone had lower survival chances.
